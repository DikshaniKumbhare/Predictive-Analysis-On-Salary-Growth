# Predictive-Analysis-On-Salary-Growth

# Aim:

To analyse EMP_dataset to find out  salary diversity and predict which factors is affects the  hike in salary by using machine learning algorithm.


# Objectives:

1. Study the factors which affect the salary of employee. 
2. Find out performance of employees.
3. Find out the number of departments. 
4. To check salary based on Performance.




# Methodology:
1. Data collection:Collected the EMP_dataset from Kaggle.
2. Exploratory Data Analyis: After cleaning process we study the descriptive statistics, visualize data based on how they are related to each other.
3. Model Development: In this vary stage we undergo the use of machine learning algorithm to model and compare which model is best to fit.
4. Visualization-Tableau



# Tools & Technology used:
1. Python and Tableau
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn,seaborn,numpy




# Conclusion:
1. We see that the number of females exceeds the number of males
2. We found that in the Production department, the number of women is more than the number of men and vice versa in the IT/IS department.
3. As we can see here that 28% of employees are very likely to leave their job for several different reasons.The reason that has the highest percentage of employees likely to quit their job is because they are unhappy.
4. Salry based on Posotion: It is clear that the salaries are according to the job title. We note that managers and developers have the highest salaries because their job is major and the most difficult in the organization. The salary raises the level of satisfaction.
5. Salary based on Departments: It is clear that the salaries are according to the department. We note that the employees of the IT department have the highest salaries between 50,000 and 220,000 .The highest paid department is the Excutive Office department, which is dollars 250000
6. Applying machine learning model,By using classification model decision tree algothim best predictive model for salary.beacuse accuracy level is greater than logistic regression that is 98%.
7. According to this model we are seen that performance score is helpful variable to decide who will get growth in salary and not.
